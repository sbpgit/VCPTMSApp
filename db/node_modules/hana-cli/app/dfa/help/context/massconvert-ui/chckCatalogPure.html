        <p class="shortdesc">Conversion Using Catalog SQL APIs</p>
        <p class="p">
            Normally conversion is done by reading the HANA Catalog and building a CDS entity defintion dynamically. We
            then use the cds.compile.to API to convert to the target output format. But this has restrictions of only
            supporting what CDS allows.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            With this option selected, we instead use the SYS.GET_OBJECT_DEFINITION stored procedure. We then strip out
            the Schema references and CS_* Types to make the output compatible with HDI and HANA Cloud
