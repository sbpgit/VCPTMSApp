        <p class="p">
            This option will override the normal conneciton configuration logic (which looks for .env and then
            default-env.json) and instead connect with a file named default-env-admin.json. Normally you will create
            this sort of connection with a power user like SYSTEM or DBADMIN. This will often give you much more access
            to foreign schemas than a normal database connection.
